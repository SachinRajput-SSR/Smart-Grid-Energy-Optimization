# AI-Powered Smart Grid Energy Optimization

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop an intelligent system for predicting and optimizing the stability of smart electrical grids using machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and computer vision technologies. The system also incorporates cybersecurity anomaly detection to safeguard critical energy infrastructure.

The goal is to enhance energy efficiency, support renewable energy integration, and improve grid reliability through AI-driven analysis of power system data.

## Dataset
- The project uses the [Smart Grid Stability Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pcbreviglieri/smart-grid-stability) from Kaggle.
- The dataset contains simulated measurements of grid parameters (voltage, current, power flow, etc.) labeled with stability status (stable/unstable).
